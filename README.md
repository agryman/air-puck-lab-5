# air-puck-lab-5

This repository ilustrates how to use R markdown to create a lab report.

The experimental data is extracted from the Google sheet and stored in multiple CSV files that each have the structure of an R dataframe. These are then imported into the R workspace and graphed and analysed. All of the graphs and computations are driven from the data so if the data changes it is easy to regenerate the report.
